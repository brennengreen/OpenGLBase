<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About Teapot

As I learned more about computer graphics and video games a like, I desire more and more to create my own game engine which would allow me to truly study the architecture and development of one. Every resource I found online lacked the friendliness torwards beginners to help spread the knowledge. Teapot is my attempt to remediate that, by designing a readibility-first engine; not focused on eeking out the best performance, or stunning graphics, but instead focused on documentation, readability, and usability.
